<h1>The Best Movies and TV Shows According to Jana and Joe</h1>
<h2>Jana and Joe Review Shows and Movies!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<P>Jana and I watched this together and really enjoyed it. We split it into two parts, 1 hour and 2 hours. The story is dark, but beautifully portrayed. We were very impressed by the use of sound throughout the movie</P>
<H3>Barbie</h3>
<P>We were not big fans of Barbie. The costumes and artistic vision were awesome! We were just bored for the most part, and didn't connect well with the plot</P>
<h3>Secret Chef 'AKA Cheffy'</h3>
<p>The game design was fun! The show was easy to watch and was about food! The chefs on the show had good personalities as well!</p>
