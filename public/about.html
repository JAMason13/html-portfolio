<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Joseph Mason, but you can call me Joe! I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer, and excited to create impactful experiences for users using my skills. My interest in this field wasn't developed in a classroom or a coding boot camp. It actually started when I was a young kid using my favorite websites, applications, and video games. I've always been interested in how information is displayed, how buttons work, and why certain labels would display incorrectly. I wanted to know why elements looked the way they did and be able to fix the issues my favorite game designers seemed to miss. I was eager to understand.

  I graduated with a degree in Crminial Justice from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2017. After gaining my degree, I spent the next year looking into the possibilities that were ahead of me. I chose to join the U.S. Army Reserves as a Military Intelligence Officer in 2019. After my initial entry training, I was looking for new opportunities, and realized I wanted to be in the technology industry. I joined a contracting company as a Help Desk Support Agent, and quickly found myself solving escalated issues. I was moved to the Functional Team, utilizing a CANVAs C# project to provide customers with a unique experience for their workflow. Shortly after, I filled the position as Lead Functional Devloper and soon after, I moved into the role as Project Coordinator. As a Project Coordinator, I oversaw three to four major projects at a time. Each project consisted of a team of 5-6; consisting of software developers, functional developers, Q/A, and a documentation specialist. My role was to provide clarity between what our partners were looking for and what the team would be doing. Utilizing Agile methods, we delivered weekly to monthly deployments, using tools such as Sql Studio, GitHub, and table extractors.

  I'm eager to create a portfolio that resembles who I am as a creator. Thank you for taking the time to read more about me!
